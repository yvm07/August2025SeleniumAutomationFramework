This is a  hybrid automation framework that combines Page Object Model (POM), Data-Driven Testing, and TestNG. It is built using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG for managing test execution, and Maven for dependency and build management. We have also integrated Allure and Chaintest Reports for detailed HTML reports, Log4j for logging, and Jenkins for continuous integration. Our test scripts and data are well organized — we follow a layered structure with base classes for setup, page classes for element locators and actions, test classes for validations, and utility classes for reusable functions like reading Excel data or taking screenshots.
We use the Page Object Model to keep the code clean and maintainable and we keep our test data in external files like Excel or JSON to make it flexible. For running tests faster, we use parallel execution in TestNG, and for running across browsers, we use Selenium Grid or Docker containers. 
We’ve integrated the whole setup with Jenkins, so tests run automatically after every code push to Git, and everyone gets quick feedback. Some features like retry for failed tests, screenshot capture on failure, and configurable environments (QA/UAT/Prod) make the framework more reliable and user-friendly. We did face challenges like test flakiness and data handling in parallel runs, but we overcame them using explicit waits and reliable locators.
